Expenses tracking is an important task for having a clear view over personal financial situation. Existing mobile apps solve this problem only partially. They either offer way to few information or require a great involvement on the user side. \AppName{} offers a solution for expenses tracking, making it easy to scan receipts and offering the extracted data in a flexible way.

For solving this problem, I developed this Android app which makes use of an advanced OCR module and a set of rules to extract the information out of receipts. This app displays a repports screen to show user's spending and offers the option to export the data in cloud to further be downloaded outside the device.

At the moment of writing and from the my research, this is an unique approach. The app is available open source on GitHub. It offers good enough results and it can easily be extended with other rules for different receipt types.
